My OS Project

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT (sorry i tried my best to make a big "ABOUT ME")

This is a OS I’m developing with as a base the episode 9 of the series "Build an OS from scratch" from Nanobyte , go check his content!
My OS a small, lightweight kernel with basic functionalities like shell commands, keyboard input, file operations, user management (incomming), and more.
I’m doing this to learn low-level programming, OS internals, and to have fun building something cool.
Features

    Simple shell with commands like help, echo, uptime, log, reboot, poweroff, cat, etc.

    File system basics (touch, append, rm, ls)

    Keyboard input handling (AZERTY layout)

    Timer interrupts and system uptime

How to build and run
    Clone the repo

    Build with make

    ./run.sh
    and if it doesn't work type chmod +x run.sh to give the run permission


Usage

    Type help in the shell to see all available commands.

    Try commands like echo Hello, uptime, log, reboot, etc.

ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m Campbell,i'm french and a hobby OS developer and programmer passionate about low-level software and systems,
before this project, i was coding module for the Linux Kernel (this is why the command are the same) and editing it , i love programming.
This project is a playground to learn and experiment.
Feel free to ask questions ,suggest improvements or signal bug! :)
